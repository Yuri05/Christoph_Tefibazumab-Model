The herein presented evaluation report evaluates the performance of the physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for tefibazumab in healthy adults. 

The presented Tefibazumab PBPK model as well as the respective evaluation plan and evaluation report are provided open-source (https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Tefibazumab-Model).
